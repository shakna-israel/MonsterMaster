# Monster Master

A young Master gets his first monster, and is propelled into a journey across the world.

---

Inspired by Pokemon, ChronoTrigger and Final Fantasy, I bring you a nostalgic RPG, in an attempt to rekindle the excitement of my youth.

You are a young Master, with a small egg.

Your journey begins at your graduation ceremony, presided over by the World Master, an expert in monster handling, capture and training.

Meet the beautiful world of Monster Master.
